Schizophrenic/hallucinating detective

Party gone wrong?/friend of friend goes missing.  Is reported and handed to our protagonist.

Seems simple murder but very quickly murderer turns up dead.

Links in secret service from 50s dropping the ball on an agent.

This is them making up for it.  

Find link between missing girl and family of secret service agent?

Seems cliche but maybe not
